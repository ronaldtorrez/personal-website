				<p>
					Many businesses and entrepreneurs struggle with websites that fail to communicate their message,
					load slowly, or simply don’t deliver results. Behind every underperforming site lies a missed
					opportunity, poor structure, neglected user experience, or outdated technology that limits growth.
					Understanding these pain points has allowed me to design solutions that truly connect with people
					and strengthen each brand’s digital presence.

					<strong class="text-light-3">I’m a Full-Stack Web Developer</strong> focused on building efficient, scalable,
					and user-centered digital products. I work <strong class="text-light-3"
						>with modern technologies such as AstroJS, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, WordPress, and Shopify</strong
					> to turn ideas into clean, functional experiences. My passion lies in combining design and technology
					to create websites that not only look great but also drive real impact, helping brands grow confidently
					in the digital world.
